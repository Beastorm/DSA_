## Infix to Postfix

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an infix expression, your task is to convert the given `infix` expression to a `postfix` expression.

---

>### Examples:

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**    
`a + b * (c^d - e) ^ (f + g * h) - i`  

**Output:**     
`abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-`  

**Explanation:**  
The infix expression is converted to postfix form by applying the rules of infix to postfix conversion.

---

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**    
`(p + q) * (m - n)`  

**Output:**   
`pq+mn-*`  

**Explanation:**     
The infix expression is converted to postfix form as `"pq+mn-*"`.

## Approach

### Algorithm:

**What is an infix expression?**  
- The traditional way of writing mathematical expressions, where the operator is placed between two operands (e.g., A + B, (A * B) / Q).
- Infix expressions are easy for humans to understand, but computers find them difficult to parse because they require knowledge of operator precedence, associativity rules, and parentheses.

**What is a postfix expression?**  
- A postfix expression has the operator placed after the operands (e.g., PQ-C/).
- In postfix expressions, the precedence of operators is determined by the order in which they appear in the expression.
- Postfix expressions do not require parentheses, making them easier for computers to evaluate.

**Approach to Convert Infix Expression to Postfix:**

1. Start by scanning the infix expression from left to right.
2. If the scanned character is an operand, print it immediately.
3. If the scanned character is an operator:
   - If the precedence of the operator is greater than the operator in the stack, or the stack is empty, or the stack contains a `(`, push the operator into the stack.
   - Otherwise, pop all operators from the stack with higher or equal precedence than the scanned operator, then push the scanned operator into the stack.
4. If the scanned character is a `(`, push it into the stack.
5. If the scanned character is a `)`, pop the stack and output the operators until a `(` is encountered, and discard both parentheses.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the entire infix expression has been scanned.
7. Print the output.
8. Finally, pop and print all remaining operators in the stack until it is empty.


### C++ Code:
``` cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to return the precedence of operators
int prec(char c) {
    if (c == '^')  // Exponent operator has highest precedence
        return 3;
    else if (c == '/' || c == '*')  // Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition
        return 2;
    else if (c == '+' || c == '-')  // Addition and subtraction have lowest precedence
        return 1;
    else
        return -1;
}

// The main function to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression
void infixToPostfix(string s) {
    stack<char> st; // Stack to hold operators and parentheses
    string result;  // String to hold the resulting postfix expression

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s[i];

        // If the scanned character is an operand, add it to the result string
        if ((c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') || (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= '0' && c <= '9'))
            result += c;

        // If the scanned character is an ‘(‘, push it to the stack
        else if (c == '(')
            st.push('(');

        // If the scanned character is a ‘)’, pop from the stack until an ‘(‘ is encountered
        else if (c == ')') {
            while (st.top() != '(') {
                result += st.top();
                st.pop();
            }
            st.pop();  // Pop the ‘(‘ from the stack
        }

        // If an operator is scanned
        else {
            while (!st.empty() && prec(s[i]) <= prec(st.top())) {
                result += st.top();
                st.pop();
            }
            st.push(c);  // Push the current operator to the stack
        }
    }

    // Pop all the remaining elements from the stack
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }

    cout << "Postfix expression: " << result << endl;  // Output the result
}

int main() {
    string exp = "(p+q)*(m-n)";  // Infix expression
    cout << "Infix expression: " << exp << endl;
    infixToPostfix(exp);  // Convert the infix expression to postfix
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
  where N is the length of the infix expression. Each character in the expression is processed once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(N)  
  where N is the length of the infix expression. The stack can hold at most N operators and parentheses in the worst case.
