## Backtracking
- Introduction to the course and what you will learn about backtracking and related concepts.
- Emphasis on understanding, identifying, and applying backtracking in problem solving.



### What's Actual Backtracking?
- Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that involves exploring all possible options and undoing ("backtracking") choices that do not lead to a solution.
- Commonly used in puzzles, constraint satisfaction, and combinatorial problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku, permutations).



### Recursion vs Backtracking
- **Recursion:** A function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
- **Backtracking:** A type of recursion where you try all possible choices, and "backtrack" (undo) when a choice doesn't lead to a solution.



### Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference
- **Pass by Value:** The function receives a copy of the variable. Changes do not affect the original.
- **Pass by Reference:** The function receives a reference to the original variable. Changes affect the original.


### Identification
- How to recognize problems that can be solved using recursion or backtracking.
- Look for problems involving choices, constraints, and the need to explore all possibilities.



### Generalization
- Abstracting solutions to apply to a broader set of problems.
- Writing flexible and reusable recursive/backtracking code.

### Data Structures vs Algorithms
- **Data Structures:** Ways to organize and store data (arrays, stacks, trees, graphs, etc.).
- **Algorithms:** Step-by-step methods for solving problems (recursion, backtracking, sorting, searching, etc.).



## Problems
- Practice problems to reinforce concepts.
- Examples: Generating subsets, permutations, solving puzzles, and more.
