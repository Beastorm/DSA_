## Types of Recursion

Recursion can be classified into several types based on how the recursive calls are made and where they appear in the function.

---

### 1. Tail Recursion:
- The recursive call is the **last operation** in the function.
- No computation is left to do after the recursive call returns.
- Can be optimized by the compiler (tail call optimization).

**Example:**
  ```cpp
  void tailRec(int n) {
      if (n == 0) return;
      cout << n << " ";
      tailRec(n - 1); // Recursive call is last
  }
  ```

### 2. Head Recursion:

- The recursive call is made **first**, before any other statements.
- Computation happens **after** the recursive call returns.

**Example:**
```cpp
void headRec(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;
    headRec(n - 1);      // Recursive call is first
    cout << n << " ";    // Computation after recursion
}
```
### 3. Tree Recursion:

- The function makes **more than one recursive call** in each invocation.
- The call structure forms a tree.

**Example (Fibonacci):**

```cpp
int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); // Two recursive calls
}
```
### 4. Indirect Recursion:

- A function calls another function, which in turn calls the first function.

**Example:**

```cpp
void funA(int n);
void funB(int n);

void funA(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << n << " ";
        funB(n - 1);
    }
}

void funB(int n) {
    if (n > 1) {
        cout << n << " ";
        funA(n / 2);
    }
}
```
**How it works:**   
funA calls funB, and funB calls funA, creating a chain of calls between the two functions.

### 5. Nested Recursion

- The recursive call is made **with an argument that is itself a recursive call**.

**Example:**

```cpp
int nestedRec(int n) {
    if (n > 100) return n - 10;
    return nestedRec(nestedRec(n + 11));
}
```
**How it works:**   
The function calls itself with a parameter that is the result of another recursive call.
This can lead to a complex and deeply nested call structure.
This pattern is seen in functions like the McCarthy 91 function.

| Type              | Description                                   | Example Function         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Tail Recursion    | Recursive call is last                        | Print n to 1            |
| Head Recursion    | Recursive call is first                       | Print 1 to n            |
| Tree Recursion    | Multiple recursive calls per function call    | Fibonacci               |
| Indirect Recursion| Functions call each other recursively         | funA, funB              |
| Nested Recursion  | Recursive call inside another recursive call  | McCarthy 91 function    |
