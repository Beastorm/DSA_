## Lecture 8: Delete Middle Element of a Stack

### Delete Middle Element of a Stack Using Recursion (IBH Approach)

You can delete the middle element of a stack using recursion by applying the Induction-Hypothesis-Base (IBH) method.

---

### Steps:

1. **Base Condition:**  
   If the current count equals the middle index, remove the top element and return.

2. **Hypothesis:**  
   Assume you can delete the middle element from a smaller stack (after popping the top).

3. **Induction:**  
   Pop the top element, recursively delete the middle from the smaller stack, then push the popped element back (unless it was the middle).

---

### C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

void deleteMiddle(stack<int>& s, int current, int middle) {
    if (current == middle) {
        s.pop(); // Base: remove the middle element
        return;
    }
    int temp = s.top();
    s.pop();
    deleteMiddle(s, current + 1, middle); // Hypothesis: delete from smaller stack
    s.push(temp); // Induction: push back non-middle elements
}

void deleteMiddleElement(stack<int>& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int middle = n / 2; // 0-based index
    deleteMiddle(s, 0, middle);
}

int main() {
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(1);
    s.push(2);
    s.push(3);
    s.push(4);
    s.push(5); // Stack: 5(top), 4, 3, 2, 1

    deleteMiddleElement(s);

    cout << "Stack after deleting middle element: ";
    while (!s.empty()) {
        cout << s.top() << " ";
        s.pop();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the stack.  
  Each element is popped and (except the middle) pushed back once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`, due to the recursion stack.  
  The maximum depth of recursion is equal to the number of elements in the stack.

### Why does this work?

- You reduce the problem size by one at each step (pop the top).
- You use the answer from the smaller problem (stack with one less element) to solve the bigger problem (push back the popped element unless it was the middle).
- You always stop at the base case (when you reach the middle).

---

### In short:

Use IBH to delete the middle element recursively:
1. Stop at the base case (middle reached),
2. Assume you can delete from a smaller stack,
3. Use that to rebuild the stack without the middle element.
