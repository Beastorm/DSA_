## Lecture 6: Sort an Array using Recursion

### Sorting an Array Using Recursion (IBH Approach)

You can sort an array recursively by applying the Induction-Hypothesis-Base (IBH) method.

---

### Steps:

1. **Base Condition:**  
   If the array has only one element (or is empty), it is already sorted.

2. **Hypothesis:**  
   Assume you can sort the first `n-1` elements of the array.

3. **Induction:**  
   Sort the first `n-1` elements recursively, then insert the last element into its correct position in the sorted part.

---

### C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to insert an element into the sorted part of the array
void insert(vector<int>& arr, int temp) {
    if (arr.size() == 0 || arr.back() <= temp) {
        arr.push_back(temp);
        return;
    }
    int val = arr.back();
    arr.pop_back();
    insert(arr, temp);
    arr.push_back(val);
}

// Recursive function to sort the array
void sortArray(vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.size() <= 1) return; // Base condition
    int temp = arr.back();
    arr.pop_back();
    sortArray(arr);              // Hypothesis: sort the rest
    insert(arr, temp);           // Induction: insert last element in sorted order
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {4, 1, 3, 2};
    sortArray(arr);
    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int x : arr) cout << x << " ";
    return 0;
}
```
### Why does this work?
- You reduce the problem size by one at each step (making the input smaller).
- You use the answer from the smaller problem (sorted subarray) to solve the bigger problem (insert the last element).
- You always stop at the base case (array of size 1 or 0).

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.  
  For each element, you may need to traverse and insert it into the sorted part, leading to quadratic time in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`, due to the recursion stack.  
  The maximum depth of recursion is equal to the number of elements in the array.

**In short:**

Use IBH to sort an array recursively:
1. Stop at the base case,
2. Assume you can sort a smaller array,
3. Use that to sort the full array by inserting the last element in the right place.
