## Height of a Binary Tree

### How to Use IBH for Trees:

The IBH method works great for trees and linked lists. Here’s how you can use it for finding the height of a binary tree:

---

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Base Condition:**  
   - If the tree is empty (node is `NULL`), its height is 0.

2. **Hypothesis:**  
   - Assume you already know how to find the height of the left and right subtrees.

3. **Induction:**  
   - The height of the current tree is 1 (for the current node) plus the bigger height of its left or right subtree.

---

### C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to compute the height of a binary tree
int height(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return 0; // Base: empty tree has height 0
    int left = height(root->left);   // Hypothesis: height of left subtree
    int right = height(root->right); // Hypothesis: height of right subtree
    return 1 + max(left, right);     // Induction: 1 + bigger of left/right
}

int main() {
    // Build a simple tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   /
    //  4
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);

    cout << "Height of the tree: " << height(root) << endl; // Output: 3

    // Free memory (not shown for brevity)
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  
  Each node is visited exactly once to compute its height.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree.  
  This is due to the recursion stack, which at most will be as deep as the height of the tree.  
  - In the worst case (skewed tree), `h = n`.
  - In the best case (balanced tree), `h = log n`.

### Why does this work?
- You break the problem into smaller parts (find the height of left and right).
- You use the answers from the smaller parts to solve the bigger problem (the whole tree).
- You always stop at the base case (empty tree).

### In short:
For trees, IBH means:
1. Stop at empty nodes,
2. Assume you can solve for smaller subtrees,
3. Use those answers to solve for the current node.
