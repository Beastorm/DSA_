## Lecture 9: Largest Number in K Swaps

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a number K and a string `str` of digits denoting a positive integer, build the largest number possible by performing swap operations on the digits of `str` at most K times.

---

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
K = 4  
str = "1234567"

**Output:**  
7654321

**Explanation:**  
Three swaps can make the input 1234567 to 7654321, swapping 1 with 7, 2 with 6, and 3 with 5.

---

## Approach

1. Use backtracking to try all possible swaps up to K times.
2. At each step, for the current position, try swapping it with every digit that is greater and comes after it.
3. After each swap, decrement K and recurse.
4. Keep track of the maximum number found so far.
5. Backtrack (undo the swap) after recursion.

---

## Backtracking Template for This Problem

- **State:** Current string, current K, and current index.
- **Choices:** Swap current index with any index > current where the digit is greater.
- **Base Case:** K is 0 or all positions are checked.
- **Backtrack:** Undo the swap.

## In short

- At each step, try all swaps that can increase the number.
- Use recursion to explore all possibilities up to K swaps.
- Keep track of the largest number found.
