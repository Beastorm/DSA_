## Permutation with Case Change | Recursion

**Problem Statement:**  
Print all permutations of a string, keeping the sequence but changing the case of each character (upper or lower).

>### Examples:

**Input:** ab    
**Output:** ab aB Ab AB   

---

## Approach

### Algo:
1. For each character in the string:
    - If it is a letter, branch into two recursive calls:
        - One with the character in lowercase.
        - One with the character in uppercase.
    - If it is not a letter, just continue with the same character.
2. When the input string is empty, print the current output.

*Recursive tree for letter case permutation with input "a1b" - letters branch into lower/upper case, while digits (like '1') are simply included without branching.*

## C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void solve(string ip, string op) {
    if (ip.length() == 0) {
        cout << op << endl;
        return;
    }
    char ch = ip[0];
    ip.erase(ip.begin());

    // If character is a letter, branch for both cases
    if (isalpha(ch)) {
        string op1 = op + (char)tolower(ch);
        string op2 = op + (char)toupper(ch);
        solve(ip, op1);
        solve(ip, op2);
    } else {
        // If not a letter, just add as is
        solve(ip, op + ch);
    }
}

int main() {
    string ip;
    cin >> ip;
    solve(ip, "");
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the number of letters in the input string.  
  - For each letter, there are two choices: lowercase or uppercase.
  - If the string has `k` non-letter characters, the total number of outputs is `2^m`, where `m` is the number of letters.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`, due to the recursion stack and the space used to build the output string at each step.

### Why does this work?

- At each step, you branch into two paths for each letter: lowercase and uppercase.
- This explores all possible case combinations while keeping the sequence.

---

### In short:

- Use recursion to explore all case changes for each character.
- Print the result when the input is empty.
