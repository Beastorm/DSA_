## Greedy Algorithms

### 🧠 Intuition
A **Greedy Algorithm** builds a solution piece by piece, always choosing the **most immediate benefit** (locally optimal choice) at that specific moment.

It assumes that by making the **best choice right now**, you will end up with the **best overall result** (globally optimal).

**Analogy:**
You are hiking and want to reach the highest peak. A greedy strategy is: "At every step, just take the steepest step upwards."
*   **Pros:** Very fast and simple.
*   **Cons:** You might get stuck on a smaller hill instead of the highest mountain (local maximum vs global maximum).

## 📝 General Algorithm
1.  **Selection Criteria:** Decide what makes an item "best" (e.g., highest value, earliest finish time, lowest cost).
2.  **Sort:** Sort the input data based on this criterion.
3.  **Iterate:** Go through the sorted items.
4.  **Select:** If the current item fits the constraints, take it. Otherwise, discard it.

## Local Maximum vs Global Maximum

### 🏔️ The Concept (Mountain Analogy)

Imagine a large mountain range with many peaks.

- **Global Maximum:** The absolute highest peak in the entire mountain range (Example: Mt. Everest).
- **Local Maximum:** A peak that is higher than everything immediately around it, but not necessarily the highest overall.

### 🎯 Greedy Algorithm Context

Greedy algorithms make decisions based on the current situation (locally).

#### Scenario: Reaching the Highest Peak
You start walking. At every step, you choose the path that goes **UP**.

1.  **Greedy Choice:** "Take the steepest step up right now."
2.  **Result:** You climb until you can't go up anymore.
3.  **Outcome:**
    - You might reach the top of a small hill (**Local Maximum**) and get stuck because going anywhere else means going down.
    - You missed the giant mountain next to it (**Global Maximum**) because getting there required going down into a valley first (which Greedy refused to do).

### ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Feature | Local Maximum | Global Maximum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Best solution within a small neighborhood | Best solution among all possible solutions |
| **Scope** | Short-term view | Long-term view |
| **Greedy finds?** | **Yes** (always) | **Maybe** (only for specific problems) |
| **Example** | Winning a battle but losing the war | Winning the war |

### 🔑 Key Takeaway
Greedy algorithms are **fast** but **risky**. They guarantee finding a local maximum, but they only find the global maximum for specific problems (like Fractional Knapsack or Activity Selection).
