## Greedy Algorithms

### 🧠 Intuition
A **Greedy Algorithm** builds a solution piece by piece, always choosing the **most immediate benefit** (locally optimal choice) at that specific moment.

It assumes that by making the **best choice right now**, you will end up with the **best overall result** (globally optimal).

**Analogy:**
You are hiking and want to reach the highest peak. A greedy strategy is: "At every step, just take the steepest step upwards."
*   **Pros:** Very fast and simple.
*   **Cons:** You might get stuck on a smaller hill instead of the highest mountain (local maximum vs global maximum).

## 📝 General Algorithm
1.  **Selection Criteria:** Decide what makes an item "best" (e.g., highest value, earliest finish time, lowest cost).
2.  **Sort:** Sort the input data based on this criterion.
3.  **Iterate:** Go through the sorted items.
4.  **Select:** If the current item fits the constraints, take it. Otherwise, discard it.
