# Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers.  
Return the length of the **longest sequence of consecutive integers**.  
The integers in this sequence can appear in **any order** in the array.

---

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  
`nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`  

**Output:**  
`4`  

**Explanation:**  
The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which has a length of 4.  
This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  
`nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]`  

**Output:**  
`9`  

**Explanation:**  
The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which has a length of 9.

## Brute Force

### Algorithm

1. For each number `x` in the array:
   - Try to build a consecutive sequence starting from `x`:
     - Check if `x + 1` exists in the array (using linear search).
     - Then check `x + 2`, `x + 3`, and so on.
2. Use a counter `cnt` to count how many consecutive numbers you can find starting from `x`.
3. Keep track of the **maximum** value of `cnt` across all starting points.
4. The maximum `cnt` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

> Note: This approach is very slow for large arrays because for every element we linearly search the entire array multiple times.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    // Helper function to perform linear search
    bool linearSearch(vector<int>& a, int num) {
        int n = a.size(); 
        // Traverse through the array 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] == num)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

public:
    // Function to find the longest consecutive sequence
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        // If the array is empty
        if (nums.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        // Initialize the longest sequence length
        int longest = 1; 

        // Iterate through each element in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Current element
            int x = nums[i]; 
            // Count of the current sequence
            int cnt = 1; 

            // Search for consecutive numbers
            while (linearSearch(nums, x + 1) == true) {
                // Move to the next number in the sequence
                x += 1; 
                // Increment the count of the sequence
                cnt += 1; 
            }

            // Update the longest sequence length found so far
            longest = max(longest, cnt);
        }
        return longest;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2};

    // Create an instance of the Solution class
    Solution solution;

    // Function call for longest consecutive sequence
    int ans = solution.longestConsecutive(a);
    cout << "The longest consecutive sequence is " << ans << "\n"; 
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$  
  Where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. For each element, we may need to perform a linear search through the entire array to 
  find consecutive numbers.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$  
  As we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables, independent of the input size.

## Better Approach: Sorting + Single Pass

**Algorithm**

1. Sort the entire array in ascending order. This groups consecutive numbers together.
2. Initialize:
   - `lastSmaller` = `INT_MIN` → tracks the last number in the current consecutive sequence.
   - `cnt` = 0 → length of the current consecutive sequence.
   - `longest` = 1 → length of the longest consecutive sequence found.
3. Iterate through the sorted array:
   - If `nums[i] - 1 == lastSmaller`, then `nums[i]` continues the current consecutive sequence:
     - Increment `cnt`.
     - Update `lastSmaller = nums[i]`.
   - Else if `nums[i] != lastSmaller` (i.e., not a duplicate and not consecutive):
     - Start a new sequence:
       - Set `cnt = 1`.
       - Update `lastSmaller = nums[i]`.
   - Update `longest = max(longest, cnt)` in each step.
4. At the end, `longest` holds the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
5. Note: This approach **sorts (distorts) the original array**, which may or may not be acceptable depending on the problem constraints.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        // Return 0 if array is empty
        if (n == 0) return 0; 

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); 

        // Track last smaller element
        int lastSmaller = INT_MIN; 
        // Count current sequence length
        int cnt = 0; 
        // Track longest sequence length
        int longest = 1; 

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // If consecutive number exists
            if (nums[i] - 1 == lastSmaller) {
                // Increment sequence count
                cnt += 1; 
                // Update last smaller element
                lastSmaller = nums[i]; 
            } 
            // If consecutive number doesn't exist and it's not a duplicate
            else if (nums[i] != lastSmaller) {
                // Reset count for new sequence
                cnt = 1; 
                // Update last smaller element
                lastSmaller = nums[i]; 
            }
            // Update longest if needed
            longest = max(longest, cnt); 
        }
        return longest;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}; 

    // Create an instance of solution class
    Solution solution; 
    // Function call for finding longest consecutive sequence
    int ans = solution.longestConsecutive(a); 
    cout << "The longest consecutive sequence is " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  
  Where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The dominant operation is sorting, which takes $O(n \log n)$. The subsequent single pass 
  over the array is $O(n)$.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$  
  Apart from a few variables (`lastSmaller`, `cnt`, `longest`), no extra data structure proportional to input size is used. 
  (Note: standard library `sort` may use $O(\log n)$ stack space internally, but asymptotically this is often treated as constant in such analyses.)

## Optimal Approach: Using Hash Set

**Algorithm**

We will use two variables:

- `cnt` → to store the length of the **current** consecutive sequence  
- `longest` → to store the **maximum** length found so far

Steps:

1. Insert all elements of the array into an `unordered_set` to allow **O(1)** average-time lookups.
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the set:
   - Consider `x` as a potential **start** of a sequence only if `x - 1` is **not** in the set.  
     (This ensures we start counting only from the beginning of each sequence.)
   - If `x` is a starting point:
     - Initialize `cnt = 1` and `current = x`.
     - While `current + 1` exists in the set, increment `current` and `cnt`.
     - Update `longest = max(longest, cnt)`.
3. After processing all elements, `longest` will contain the length of the **longest consecutive sequence**.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        // If the array is empty
        if (n == 0) return 0; 
    
        // Initialize the longest sequence length
        int longest = 1; 
        unordered_set<int> st;
    
        // Put all the array elements into the set
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            st.insert(a[i]);
        }
    
        /* Traverse the set to 
           find the longest sequence  */
        for (auto it : st) {
            // Check if 'it' is a starting number of a sequence
            if (st.find(it - 1) == st.end()) {
                // Initialize the count of the current sequence
                int cnt = 1; 
                // Starting element of the sequence
                int x = it; 
    
                // Find consecutive numbers in the set
                while (st.find(x + 1) != st.end()) {
                    // Move to the next element in the sequence
                    x = x + 1; 
                    // Increment the count of the sequence
                    cnt = cnt + 1; 
                }
                // Update the longest sequence length
                longest = max(longest, cnt);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}; 

    // Create an instance of solution class
    Solution solution; 
    // Function call for finding longest consecutive sequence
    int ans = solution.longestConsecutive(a); 
    cout << "The longest consecutive sequence is " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  
  Where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. We traverse each element once to build the set and then again (effectively once overall across sequences) to find the longest consecutive sequence.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$  
  As we use a set to store the unique elements of the array, which in the worst case can be equal to the size of the input array.
