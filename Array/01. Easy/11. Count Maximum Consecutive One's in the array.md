# Count Maximum Consecutive One's in the array

**Problem Statement:**   
Given an array that contains only 1 and 0, return the count of the maximum consecutive ones in the array.

>### Examples

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array, out of which the maximum is 3.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

## Approach: Iterative Counting

### Algorithm:

We need to find the longest streak of consecutive 1’s in a binary array. A simple idea is to traverse the array while maintaining a counter. Every time we encounter a 1, we increase the counter. If we encounter a 0, the streak breaks, so we reset the counter to 0. At each step, we track the maximum streak length seen so far.

1.  Initialize two variables:
    *   `cnt` → counts the current streak of 1’s.
    *   `maxi` → stores the maximum streak found so far.
2.  Traverse through the array:
    *   If `nums[i] == 1`, increment `cnt`.
    *   If `nums[i] == 0`, reset `cnt` to 0.
    *   Update `maxi = max(maxi, cnt)` at each step.
3.  Finally, return `maxi`, which contains the length of the longest consecutive 1’s.



### C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find maximum consecutive 1's in an array
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int> &nums) {
        // Variable to store current count of consecutive 1's
        int cnt = 0;
        // Variable to store the maximum consecutive 1's
        int maxi = 0;

        // Traverse the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // If current element is 1, increment count
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                cnt++;
            } else {
                // If element is 0, reset count
                cnt = 0;
            }

            // Update maximum if current count is greater
            maxi = max(maxi, cnt);
        }

        // Return maximum consecutive 1's
        return maxi;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Input array
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};

    // Create Solution object
    Solution obj;

    // Get answer
    int ans = obj.findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums);

    // Print result
    cout << "The maximum consecutive 1's are " << ans;
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
    Since we scan the array once.

*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    As only constant extra variables are used.
