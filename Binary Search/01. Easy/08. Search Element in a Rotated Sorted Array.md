## Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an integer array `nums`, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), and a target value `k`. The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. 
Find the index at which `k` is present, and if `k` is not present, return `-1`.


>### Examples:

#### Example 1:

-   **Input:** `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `k = 0`
-   **Output:** `4`
-   **Explanation:** Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, `nums`. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

#### Example 2:

-   **Input:** `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `k = 3`
-   **Output:** `-1`
-   **Explanation:** Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as `-1`.

## Brute Force Approach

### Algorithm:

The brute force way is to simply check each element from left to right. If we find the target, we return its index; otherwise, we return -1 after scanning the entire array.

1.  Start a loop from the first element to the last element.
2.  For each element:
    -   Compare it with the target value.
    -   If it matches the target, return the current index immediately.
3.  If the loop finishes and no match is found, return -1.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to search target in a rotated sorted array using brute force
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

        // Loop through each element in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {

            // If current element matches target, return index
            if (nums[i] == target) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // If not found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
};

// Driver code
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};
    int target = 0;

    Solution obj;
    int index = obj.search(nums, target);

    cout << index << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, We may need to check every element in the worst case if the target is not present.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, No extra space is used; only constant variables.
