## Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array

**Problem Statement:**  
You're given a sorted array `arr` of `n` integers and an integer `x`. Find the floor and ceiling of `x` in `arr[0..n-1]`.

- **The floor of x** is the largest element in the array that is smaller than or equal to `x`.
- **The ceiling of x** is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to `x`.

---

>### Examples:

#### Example 1:

- **Input Format:** `n = 6`, `arr[] = {3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}`, `x = 5`
- **Result:** `4 7`
- **Explanation:** The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

#### Example 2:

-   **Input Format:** `n = 6`, `arr[] = {3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}`, `x = 8`
-   **Result:** `8 8`
-   **Explanation:** The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.

### Ceil:

1.  We will declare 2 pointers and an `ans` variable initialized to -1 (If we don’t find any index, we will return `-1`).

2.  *Place the 2 pointers, i.e., `low` and `high`:* Initially, we will place the pointers like this: `low` will point to the first index and `high` will point to the last index.

3.  *Calculate the `mid`:* Now, we will calculate the value of `mid` using the following formula:
    ```text
    mid = (low + high) // 2    // ‘//’ refers to integer division
    ```

4.  *Compare `arr[mid]` with `x`:* With comparing `arr[mid]` to `x`, we can observe 2 different cases:
    - *Case 1 - If `arr[mid] >= x`:* This condition means that the index `arr[mid]` may be an answer. So, we will update the `ans` variable with `arr[mid]` and search in the *left half* if there is any smaller number that satisfies the same condition. Here, we are eliminating the right half.
    - *Case 2 - If `arr[mid] < x`:* In this case, `arr[mid]` cannot be our answer, and we need to find a bigger element. So, we will eliminate the left half and search in the *right half* for the answer.

### Floor:

1.  We will declare 2 pointers and an `ans` variable initialized to -1 (If we don’t find any index, we will return `-1`).
2.  *Place the 2 pointers, i.e., `low` and `high`:* Initially, we will place the pointers like this: `low` will point to the first index and `high` will point to the last index.
3.  *Calculate the `mid`:* Now, we will calculate the value of `mid` using the following formula:
    ```text
    mid = (low + high) // 2    // ‘//’ refers to integer division
    ```
4.  *Compare `arr[mid]` with `x`:* With comparing `arr[mid]` to `x`, we can observe 2 different cases:
    -   *Case 1 - If `arr[mid] <= x`:* The index `arr[mid]` is a possible answer. So, we will store it and will try to find a larger number that satisfies the same condition. That is why we will remove the left half and try to find the number in the right half.
    -   *Case 2 - If `arr[mid] > x`:* `arr[mid]` is definitely not the answer, and we need a smaller number. So, we will reduce the search space to the left half by removing the right half.

```
### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O(logN)`, where `N` = size of the given array. We are using the Binary Search algorithm.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. No extra space used.
