# Theory
## 1. Binary Search on Answer (Binary Search on Range):

**Normal binary search:**
- You have a **sorted array**.
- You search **in the array** for a value.

**Binary search on answer:**
- You **don’t** search inside the array.
- You search on a **range of possible answers** (a number line).
- For each guess `mid`, you ask:  
  **“Is this `mid` a valid answer?”**
- Based on YES/NO, you move **left or right** on that range.

### Example: Koko Eating Bananas

- Possible speeds: `k ∈ [1, max(piles)]`.
- For a guess `mid`:
  - We check: “If Koko eats at speed = `mid`, can she finish in `h` hours?”
- If she **can**, maybe a **smaller** speed also works → search **left**.
- If she **cannot**, speed is too small → search **right**.

Here, the “array” is really the **range of answers** `[1..maxPile]`, not an actual array.

## 2. Opposite Polarity:

This is about what you do when your guessed `mid` **works** (condition is true).

There are **two types of goals**:

### Polarity 1 – Minimize the Value (smallest valid `mid`)

- **Goal:** Find the **smallest** `mid` that is valid.
- If `mid` works:
  - Save it as a **candidate answer**.
  - Try to find an even **smaller** one → go **left**:
    ```cpp
    ans = mid;
    high = mid - 1;
    ```
- **Examples:**  
  Koko Eating Bananas, Allocate Books, Split Array – Largest Sum, Smallest Divisor.

### Polarity 2 – Maximize the Value (largest valid `mid`)

- **Goal:** Find the **largest** `mid` that is valid.
- If `mid` works:
  - Save it as a **candidate answer**.
  - Try to find an even **larger** one → go **right**:
    ```cpp
    ans = mid;
    low = mid + 1;
    ```
- **Examples:**  
  Aggressive Cows (maximize the minimum distance between cows).

## 3. Why We Need These Ideas:

- Many problems don’t have a direct formula for the answer, but:
  - We can **guess** a value `mid`.
  - We can test a function `can(mid)` → is it **possible** or not?
  - The set of valid `mid` values is **monotonic**:
    - For minimize: if `mid` works, all **larger** might also work.
    - For maximize: if `mid` works, all **smaller** might also work.
- This monotonic pattern lets us use **binary search on the answer range**.

So, in short:

- **Binary search on answer** = binary search on a **number line of possible answers**.
- **Opposite polarity** = how you move `low`/`high` after a successful `mid`,
  depending on whether you want the **smallest** or **largest** valid value.
