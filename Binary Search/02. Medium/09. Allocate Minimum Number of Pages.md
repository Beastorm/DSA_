## Allocate Minimum Number of Pages

**Problem Statement:**   

Given an array `arr` of integer numbers, `arr[i]` represents the number of pages in the `i-th` book. There are an `m` number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

1.  Each student gets at least one book.
2.  Each book should be allocated to only one student.
3.  Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

You have to allocate the books to `m` students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible, return `-1`.


>### Examples:

#### Example 1:

-   **Input Format:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `arr[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}`
-   **Result:** `113`
-   **Explanation:** The allocation of books will be `12, 34, 67 | 90`. One student will get the first 3 books and the other will get the last one.

#### Example 2:

-   **Input Format:** `n = 5`, `m = 4`, `arr[] = {25, 46, 28, 49, 24}`
-   **Result:** `71`
-   **Explanation:** The allocation of books will be `25, 46 | 28 | 49 | 24`.

## Brute Force Approach

### Algorithm:

1.  **If `m > n`:** In this case, book allocation is not possible, and so, we will return -1.
2.  Next, we will find the maximum element and the summation of the given array.
3.  We will use a loop (say `pages`) to check all possible pages from `max(arr[])` to `sum(arr[])`.
4.  Next, inside the loop, we will send each `pages` to the function `countStudents()` to get the number of students to whom we can allocate the books.
5.  The first number of pages, `pages`, for which the number of students will be equal to `m`, will be our answer. So, we will return those particular `pages`.
6.  Finally, if we are out of the loop, we will return `max(arr[])` as there cannot exist any answer smaller than that.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class Solution{
int countStudents(vector<int> &arr, int pages) {
    int n = arr.size(); //size of array.
    int students = 1;
    long long pagesStudent = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (pagesStudent + arr[i] <= pages) {
            //add pages to current student
            pagesStudent += arr[i];
        }
        else {
            //add pages to next student
            students++;
            pagesStudent = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return students;
}

int findPages(vector<int>& arr, int n, int m) {
    //book allocation impossible:
    if (m > n) return -1;

    int low = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int high = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

    for (int pages = low; pages <= high; pages++) {
        if (countStudents(arr, pages) == m) {
            return pages;
        }
    }
    return low;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {25, 46, 28, 49, 24};
    int n = 5;
    int m = 4;
    int ans = findPages(arr, n, m);
    cout << "The answer is: " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O(N * (sum(arr[]) - max(arr[]) + 1))`, where `N` = size of the array, `sum(arr[])` = sum of all array elements, and `max(arr[])` = maximum element in the array.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
