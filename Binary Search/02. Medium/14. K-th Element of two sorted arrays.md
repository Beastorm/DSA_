## K-th Element of two sorted arrays

**Problem Statement:**  
Given two sorted arrays `a` and `b` of size `m` and `n` respectively. Find the `k`-th element of the final sorted array.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:

-   **Input:** `a = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, `b = [1, 4, 8, 10]`, `k = 5`
-   **Output:** `6`
-   **Explanation:** The final sorted array would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The 5th element of this array is 6.

#### Example 2:

-   **Input:** `a = [100, 112, 256, 349, 770]`, `b = [72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892]`, `k = 7`
-   **Output:** `256`
-   **Explanation:** The final sorted array is `[72, 86, 100, 112, 113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892]`. The 7th element of this array is 256.

### Approach

#### Algorithm:

1.  First, ensure that `arr1` is the smaller array. If not, swap the arrays. Our goal is to treat `arr1[]` as the smaller array.
2.  Calculate the length of the left half as `left = k`.
3.  Initialize two pointers:
    -   `low` will point to `max(0, k - n2)`.
    -   `high` will point to `min(k, n1)`.
    (where `n1` is the size of the smaller array and `n2` is the size of the larger array).
4.  Calculate `mid1` and `mid2`:
    -   `mid1 = (low + high) // 2` (integer division).
    -   `mid2 = left - mid1`.
5.  Inside the loop, calculate `l1`, `l2`, `r1`, and `r2`:
    -   `l1 = arr1[mid1 - 1]`
    -   `l2 = arr2[mid2 - 1]`
    -   `r1 = arr1[mid1]`
    -   `r2 = arr2[mid2]`
    -   If `mid1` or `mid2` is out of bounds, set `l1`, `l2` to `INT_MIN` and `r1`, `r2` to `INT_MAX`.
6.  Eliminate halves based on the following conditions:
    -   If `l1 <= r2` and `l2 <= r1`, the answer is found. Return the maximum of `l1` and `l2`.
    -   If `l1 > r2`, eliminate the right half by setting `high = mid1 - 1`.
    -   If `l2 > r1`, eliminate the left half by setting `low = mid1 + 1`.
7.  When the loop terminates, include a dummy return statement to avoid warnings or errors.    


>[!NOTE] 
>   Why `low = max(0, k - n)` and `high = min(k, m)` ?
>1. We do binary search on how many elements we take from array `a` into the left part – call this `mid1`.  
>2. The rest must come from `b`, so `mid2 = k - mid1`, and both `mid1` and `mid2` must be valid (not negative and not beyond their array sizes).  
>3. `mid2` cannot be more than `n`, so `mid1` must be **at least** `k - n` (otherwise we’d be asking `b` for more elements than it has).  
>4. `mid1` cannot be more than `m`, and also not more than `k` itself.  
>5. Therefore, the valid search range for `mid1` is: `low = max(0, k - n)` and `high = min(k, m)`.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int kthElement(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b, int k) {
        int m = a.size();
        int n = b.size();

        // Ensure `a` is a smaller array for optimization
        if (m > n) {
            // Swap a and b
            return kthElement(b, a, k); 
        }
        
        // Length of the left half
        int left = k; 

        // Apply binary search
        int low = max(0, k - n), high = min(k, m);

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid1 = (low + high) >> 1;
            int mid2 = left - mid1;

            // Initialize l1, l2, r1, r2
            int l1 = (mid1 > 0) ? a[mid1 - 1] : INT_MIN;
            int l2 = (mid2 > 0) ? b[mid2 - 1] : INT_MIN;
            int r1 = (mid1 < m) ? a[mid1] : INT_MAX;
            int r2 = (mid2 < n) ? b[mid2] : INT_MAX;

            // Check if we have found the answer
            if (l1 <= r2 && l2 <= r1) {
                return max(l1, l2);
            } 
            else if (l1 > r2) {
                // Eliminate the right half
                high = mid1 - 1;
            } 
            else {
                // Eliminate the left half
                low = mid1 + 1;
            }
        }
        
         // Dummy return statement 
        return -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9};
    vector<int> b = {1, 4, 8, 10};
    int k = 5;
    
    //Create an instance of the Solution class
    Solution solution;
    
    //Print the answer
    cout << "The " << k << "-th element of two sorted arrays is: "
         << solution.kthElement(a, b, k) << '\n';

    return 0;
}


```
### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O(log(min(M, N)))`, where `M` and `N` are the sizes of the two given arrays. As binary search is being applied on the range `[max(0, k - N2), min(k, N1)]`, the range length is `<= min(M, N)`.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no additional space is used.
