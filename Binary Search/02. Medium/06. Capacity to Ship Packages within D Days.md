## Capacity to Ship Packages within D Days

**Problem Statement:**  
You are the owner of a shipment company. You use conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another. The packages must be shipped within `d` days. 
The weights of the packages are given in an array `of weights`. The packages are loaded on the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array. 
The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship. Find out the least-weight capacity so that you can ship all the packages within `d` days.

>### Examples:

**Example 1:**  

- #### Input:
  - `weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
  - `d = 5` days

We need the *minimum ship capacity* so that all packages can be shipped in at most 5 days, in order.

Try some capacities:

- *Capacity = 9*
  - Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 > 9 → so only [1,2,3] → load = 6  
  - Day 2: 4 + 5 = 9  
  - Day 3: 6 + 7 = 13 > 9 → only [6] → load = 6  
  - Day 4: 7 + 8 = 15 > 9 → only [7] → load = 7  
  - Day 5: 8 + 9 = 17 > 9 → only [8] → load = 8  
  - Need Day 6 for [9] → *6 days*, too many.

- *Capacity = 15*
  - Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15  
  - Day 2: 6 + 7 = 13  
  - Day 3: 8 + 9 = 17 > 15 → only [8]  
  - Day 4: 9  
  - *4 days* ≤ 5 → works.

Check a smaller one:

- *Capacity = 14*
  - Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 > 14 → only [1,2,3,4] → load = 10  
  - Day 2: 5 + 6 = 11  
  - Day 3: 7 = 7  
  - Day 4: 8 = 8  
  - Day 5: 9 = 9  
  - *5 days* → still works.

Try *Capacity = 13*:

- Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 > 13 → [1,2,3,4] → 10  
- Day 2: 5 + 6 = 11  
- Day 3: 7 = 7  
- Day 4: 8 = 8  
- Day 5: 9 = 9  
- *5 days* → still works.

Try *Capacity = 12*:

- Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
- Day 2: 5 + 6 = 11  
- Day 3: 7 = 7  
- Day 4: 8 = 8  
- Day 5: 9 = 9  
- *5 days* → still works.

Try *Capacity = 11*:

- Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
- Day 2: 5 + 6 = 11  
- Day 3: 7 = 7  
- Day 4: 8 = 8  
- Day 5: 9 = 9  
- *5 days* → still works.

Try *Capacity = 10*:

- Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
- Day 2: 5 = 5  
- Day 3: 6 = 6  
- Day 4: 7 = 7  
- Day 5: 8 = 8  
- Day 6: 9 = 9  
- *6 days* → too many.

So the *minimum capacity* that works is:

- *Answer:* `11`


---

**Example 2:**   

- #### Input:
  - `weights = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4]`.
  - `d = 3` days

Try some capacities:

- *Capacity = 6*
  - Day 1: 3 + 2 = 5, next 2 would exceed (7 > 6)  
  - Day 2: 2 + 4 = 6  
  - Day 3: 1 + 4 = 5  
  - *3 days* → works.

Check smaller:

- *Capacity = 5*
  - Day 1: 3 + 2 = 5  
  - Day 2: 2 = 2, + 4 would be 6 > 5  
  - Day 3: 4 = 4  
  - Day 4: 1 + 4 = 5  
  - *4 days* → too many.

So the *smallest* capacity that works is:

- *Answer:* `6`

---

**Example 3:**  

- #### Input:
  - `weights = [10, 50, 50, 10]`.
  - `d = 2` days

We need to load these over 2 days.

- Minimum possible capacity must be at least `max(weights) = 50`.

Try:

- *Capacity = 50*
  - Day 1: 10 + 50 = 60 > 50 → only [10]  
  - Day 2: 50 = 50  
  - Day 3: 10 = 10  
  - *3 days* → too many.

- *Capacity = 60*
  - Day 1: 10 + 50 = 60  
  - Day 2: 50 + 10 = 60  
  - *2 days* → works.

Check smaller:

- *Capacity = 55*
  - Day 1: 10 + 50 = 60 > 55 → only [10]  
  - Day 2: 50 = 50  
  - Day 3: 50 + 10 = 60 > 55 → [50]  
  - Day 4: 10  
  - *4 days* → too many.

So the *minimum capacity* for 2 days is:

- *Answer:* `60`

## Brute Force Approach

### Algorithm:

The problem asks to find the minimum capacity of the ship such that all packages can be shipped within `d` days.
A brute force way is to check every capacity starting from the maximum single package weight (since capacity can't be less than the heaviest package) 
up to the sum of all package weights (which guarantees all packages are shipped in one day). For each capacity, simulate the shipping process day by day. 
The smallest capacity that ships all packages in `≤ d` days is the answer.

1.  Find the maximum weight in the array (minimum capacity possible).
2.  Calculate the sum of all weights (maximum capacity possible).
3.  For each capacity from max weight to sum:
    -   Simulate shipping: load packages one by one until capacity is reached, then move to the next day.
    -   If total days used is `≤ d`, return that capacity.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check how many days are needed for the given capacity
    int daysNeeded(vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
        // Initialize day count to 1
        int days = 1;
        // Current load for the day
        int currentLoad = 0;

        // Iterate over all package weights
        for (int w : weights) {
            // If adding weight exceeds capacity
            if (currentLoad + w > capacity) {
                // Increase day count and reset load
                days++;
                currentLoad = w;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, add weight to the current load
                currentLoad += w;
            }
        }
        // Return total days needed
        return days;
    }

    // Function to find minimum ship capacity to ship in d days
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int d) {
        // Find maximum weight as minimum capacity
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        // Find total sum as maximum capacity
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

        // Iterate from minimum to maximum capacity
        for (int capacity = left; capacity <= right; capacity++) {
            // Calculate days needed for current capacity
            int needed = daysNeeded(weights, capacity);
            // If days needed are less than or equal to d, return capacity
            if (needed <= d) {
                return capacity;
            }
        }
        // Should never reach here given constraints
        return right;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Input weights
    vector<int> weights = {5,4,5,2,3,4,5,6};
    // Days to ship
    int d = 5;
    // Create Solution instance
    Solution sol;
    // Call the function and print the result
    cout << sol.shipWithinDays(weights, d) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O((sum_weights - max_weight) * N)`, where N is the number of packages. For each capacity between max weight and total sum, we simulate shipping over N packages.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, only constant extra space is used.

## Optimal Approach

### Algorithm:

We want to find the minimum ship capacity that allows shipping all packages within the given number of days. The capacity must be at least the 
heaviest package because you can’t split a package. At the same time, the capacity can be at most the sum of all packages (if you ship everything in one day). 
So the answer lies between these two extremes. Using binary search on this range lets us efficiently find the smallest capacity that works. For each candidate capacity,
We check if it’s possible to ship all packages within the given days by greedily accumulating package weights until we reach capacity, then moving to the next day.

1.  Set the lower bound as the maximum weight in the packages.
2.  Set the upper bound as the sum of all package weights.
3.  While the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound, do:
    -   Pick the middle value between the lower and upper bounds as the candidate capacity.
    -   Simulate shipping with this capacity: accumulate package weights until capacity is reached, then count a day and reset the accumulation.
    -   If the number of days used is within the allowed days, move the upper bound down to try smaller capacities.
    -   If the number of days exceeds the allowed days, increase the lower bound to try larger capacities.
4.  Return the lower bound when the search finishes as the minimum capacity needed.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate how many days are needed to ship packages with a given capacity
    int daysNeeded(vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
        // Initialize count of days to 1 (start with day one)
        int days = 1;

        // Variable to track the current load on the ship for a day
        int currentLoad = 0;

        // Loop through each package weight in the array
        for (int w : weights) {
            // Check if adding the current package exceeds the ship capacity for the day
            if (currentLoad + w > capacity) {
                // Need a new day to ship this package, so increment the day count
                days++;

                // Start new day's load with current package weight
                currentLoad = w;
            } else {
                // If capacity not exceeded, add current package weight to the day's load
                currentLoad += w;
            }
        }

        // Return total number of days needed with this capacity
        return days;
    }

    // Main function to find minimum capacity to ship all packages within d days
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int d) {
        // Find the maximum package weight as the minimum capacity (can't be less than this)
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());

        // Calculate the sum of all package weights as the maximum capacity (ship all at once)
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

        // Binary search loop to find optimal capacity between left and right
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate mid value as potential capacity to test
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Calculate how many days are needed if the ship capacity is mid
            int needed = daysNeeded(weights, mid);

            // If the days needed are less than or equal to the allowed days,
            // try to reduce capacity by moving the right boundary
            if (needed <= d) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                // If the days needed are more than allowed, increase capacity by moving the left boundary
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // Left is now the minimum capacity that can ship packages within d days
        return left;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Define the package weights
    vector<int> weights = {5,4,5,2,3,4,5,6};

    // Define the number of days within which packages must be shipped
    int d = 5;

    // Create Solution object
    Solution sol;

    // Call the function and output the result
    cout << sol.shipWithinDays(weights, d) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

-   **Time Complexity:** `O(N * log(S))`, where `N` is the number of packages and `S` is the search space (`sum_weights - max_weight`).
      Each binary search step takes `O(N)`, repeated `O(log S)` times.
-   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, constant extra space is used.
