# 📝 Isomorphic String

**Problem Statement** [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ISNCDJEgqQ)  
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are **isomorphic**.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

- All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
- No two characters may map to the same character.
- A character may map to itself.

### 💡 Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`s = "paper", t = "title"`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
The characters in `s` can be mapped one-to-one to characters in `t`:

- `'p'` → `'t'`
- `'a'` → `'i'`
- `'e'` → `'l'`
- `'r'` → `'e'`

Since the mapping is consistent and unique for each character, the strings are isomorphic.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`s = "foo", t = "bar"`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
- `'f'` → `'b'` is fine.
- `'o'` → `'a'` for the first `'o'`, but the second `'o'` in `s` would need to map to `'r'` in `t`, which conflicts with the earlier mapping of `'o'` → `'a'`.

This inconsistency makes it impossible to convert `s` to `t` using a one-to-one character mapping.

## 🧠 Approach

### Algorithm
- Think of isomorphism as a consistent one-to-one mapping between characters of two strings.
- The goal is to ensure the pattern of appearances and repetitions is identical in both strings.
- Use two fixed-size arrays (size `256`) to track the last-seen positions of characters from each string.
- While scanning both strings together, compare if the characters at the current position have been seen at the same relative positions before.
- If not, it indicates inconsistent mapping (one character maps to multiple others) → return `false`.
- If consistent, update the last seen position of both characters to ensure future checks remain valid.
- This approach confirms isomorphic structure by comparing character occurrence patterns, not the characters themselves.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  
  class Solution {
  public:
      // Method to check if two strings are isomorphic
      bool isomorphicString(string s, string t) {
          // Arrays to store last seen positions of characters in s and t
          int m1[256] = {0}, m2[256] = {0}; 
          
          // Get the length of the strings
          int n = s.size(); 
          
          // Traverse each character of the strings
          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
              // If previous positions of current characters differ, return false
              if (m1[s[i]] != m2[t[i]]) return false;
              
              // Update the position with current index + 1
              m1[s[i]] = i + 1;
              m2[t[i]] = i + 1;
          }
          
          // If no mismatch is found, return true
          return true;
      }
  };
  
  // Main function to test the method
  int main() {
      // Create object of Solution
      Solution solution;
      
      // Sample input strings
      string s = "paper";
      string t = "title";
      
      // Check if strings are isomorphic
      if (solution.isomorphicString(s, t)) {
          cout << "Strings are isomorphic." << endl;
      } else {
          cout << "Strings are not isomorphic." << endl;
      }
      
      return 0;
  }
```
### 📊 Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: `O(N)`**  
`N` is the length of the input strings. We iterate through each character once using a single loop.

**Space Complexity: `O(1)`**  
The arrays are fixed size (`256`), so the extra space remains constant regardless of input size.
