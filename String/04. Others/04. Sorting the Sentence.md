## Sorting the Sentence

**Problem Statement:**   
A sentence is a list of words separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the **1-indexed position** to each word, then rearranging the words.

For example, `"This is a sentence"` can be shuffled as:
- `"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"` or
- `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`

Given a shuffled sentence `s` containing no more than **9 words**, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

>### Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`  
**Output:** `"This is a sentence"`  

**Explanation:**  
Sort words by their positions: `"This1 is2 a3 sentence4"`, then remove the digits.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"`  
**Output:** `"Me Myself and I"`  

**Explanation:**  
Sort words by their positions: `"Me1 Myself2 and3 I4"`, then remove the digits.

---

### Constraints
- `2 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `1` to `9`
- Number of words in `s` is between `1` and `9`
- Words are separated by a single space
- `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces

---
## Approach

### Intuition:
Each word in the shuffled sentence has its **original position** attached at the end (1 to 9), e.g. `"This1"`, `"is2"`.  
So we can:
- extract each word,
- read its last digit to know the correct position,
- store the word (without the digit) at that position,
- finally join all stored words in order.


### Algorithm:
1. Create a vector `ans` of size `10` to store words by position (`1..9`).
2. Scan the string `s` and build each word in a temporary string `temp` until a space is found.
3. When a word ends:
   - `pos = last character of temp` (digit)
   - remove the digit from `temp`
   - store `ans[pos] = temp`
   - clear `temp` and increase word count
4. After the loop, process the last word similarly (since no trailing space).
5. Build the final sentence by concatenating `ans[1]` to `ans[count]` with single spaces.
6. Return the final string.

### C++ Code: 
``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string sortSentence(string s) {
        vector<string> ans(10); // because positions are 1 to 9
        string temp = "";
        int count = 0;          // number of words

        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                // last char of temp is digit position
                int pos = temp.back() - '0';
                temp.pop_back();          // remove digit
                ans[pos] = temp;          // place word at correct position
                temp.clear();
                count++;
            } else {
                temp += s[i];
            }
        }

        // process last word (no trailing space)
        int pos = temp.back() - '0';
        temp.pop_back();
        ans[pos] = temp;
        count++;

        // build final sentence
        string res = "";
        for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
            res += ans[i];
            if (i != count) res += ' ';
        }
        return res;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;

    string s1 = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3";
    cout << "Input:  " << s1 << "\n";
    cout << "Output: " << sol.sortSentence(s1) << "\n\n"; // This is a sentence

    string s2 = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3";
    cout << "Input:  " << s2 << "\n";
    cout << "Output: " << sol.sortSentence(s2) << "\n";   // Me Myself and I

    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**  
   We scan the sentence once and build the output once, where `n` is the length of the string.

- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**  
   We use a fixed-size array/vector of size `10` (since at most 9 words).  
   (Overall output string still takes `O(n)` space.)
