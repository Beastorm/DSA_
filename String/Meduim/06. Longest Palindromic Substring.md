# Longest Palindromic Substring

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`.

---

### Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`s = "babad"`

**Output:**  
`"bab"`

**Explanation:**  
It is the longest palindromic substring. `"aba"` is also a valid answer.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`s = "cbbd"`

**Output:**  
`"bb"`

**Explanation:**  
It is the longest palindromic substring.

## Approach

### Algorithm
- The goal is to find the longest palindromic substring by treating each character (and each pair) as a potential **center**.
- Every palindrome is symmetric, so we **expand outward** from a center to check for symmetry.
- There are two types of centers to consider:
  - One at a character (**odd-length** palindrome)
  - One between two characters (**even-length** palindrome)
- For each center, expand left and right while the characters on both sides match.
- Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found by updating its start and end indices.
- The final result is the substring between the recorded boundaries of the longest expansion.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string str) {
        int start = 0, end = 0;

        // Iterate through each character as center
        for (int center = 0; center < str.length(); center++) {
            // Expand around odd length palindrome
            int lenOdd = expandFromCenter(str, center, center);
            // Expand around even length palindrome
            int lenEven = expandFromCenter(str, center, center + 1);
            // Get the max of both lengths
            int maxLen = max(lenOdd, lenEven);

            // Update the longest palindrome boundaries
            if (maxLen > end - start) {
                start = center - (maxLen - 1) / 2;
                end = center + maxLen / 2;
            }
        }

        // Return the longest palindromic substring
        return str.substr(start, end - start + 1);
    }

private:
    int expandFromCenter(const string& str, int left, int right) {
        // Expand while characters match and within bounds
        while (left >= 0 && right < str.length() && str[left] == str[right]) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        // Return the length of the palindrome
        return right - left - 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string input = "babad";
    cout << "Longest Palindromic Substring: " << sol.longestPalindrome(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: `O(N²)`**  
For each character (and pair of characters), expanding around the center could take up to `O(N)`.

**Space Complexity: `O(1)`**  
No extra space is used.
