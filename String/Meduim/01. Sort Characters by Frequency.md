# Sort Characters by Frequency

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a string `s`. Return the array of **unique characters**, sorted by **highest to lowest** occurring characters.  
If two or more characters have the same frequency, arrange them in **alphabetic order**.


### Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`s = "tree"`

**Output:**  
`['e', 'r', 't']`

**Explanation:**
- `e → 2`
- `r → 1`
- `t → 1`

Since `'r'` and `'t'` have the same frequency, they are sorted alphabetically (`'r'` comes before `'t'`).

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`s = "raaaajj"`

**Output:**  
`['a', 'j', 'r']`

**Explanation:**
- `a → 4`
- `j → 2`
- `r → 1`

Characters are sorted by decreasing frequency. In case of ties, alphabetically.

## Approach

### Algorithm
- The goal is to rank characters based on how frequently they appear in the string.
- We need a structure that can track both the character and how often it occurs.
- Sorting the characters by frequency helps surface the most significant ones first.
- To maintain consistency when frequencies match, tie-breaking is done alphabetically.
- Once sorted, the characters with non-zero occurrences form the final ranked result.

``` cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    // Custom comparator: sort by frequency descending, then by character ascending
    static bool comparator(pair<int, char> p1, pair<int, char> p2) {
        if (p1.first > p2.first) return true;
        if (p1.first < p2.first) return false;
        return p1.second < p2.second;
    }

public:
    vector<char> frequencySort(string& s) {
        // Array to store frequency and character
        pair<int, char> freq[26];
        
        // Initialize frequency array with character labels
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            freq[i] = {0, i + 'a'};
        }

        // Count frequency of each character in string
        for (char ch : s) {
            freq[ch - 'a'].first++;
        }

        // Sort the frequency array using the custom comparator
        sort(freq, freq + 26, comparator);

        // Store characters with non-zero frequency
        vector<char> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i].first > 0) ans.push_back(freq[i].second);
        }

        // Return the result
        return ans;
    }
};

// Main function to test the logic
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    
    // Example input string
    string s = "tree";

    // Get the sorted characters by frequency
    vector<char> result = sol.frequencySort(s);

    // Print the result
    for (char c : result) {
        cout << c << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: `O(n + k log k)`**  
`n` is the length of the string and `k = 26` (alphabet size).  
Counting frequencies takes `O(n)`, and sorting unique characters takes `O(k log k)`.

**Space Complexity: `O(k)`**  
We use a frequency array of size `k = 26`.
