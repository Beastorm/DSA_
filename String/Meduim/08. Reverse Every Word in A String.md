# Reverse Every Word in A String

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an input string containing upper-case and lower-case letters, digits, and spaces (`' '`), a **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` are separated by at least one space.

Return a string with the words in **reverse order**, concatenated by a **single space**.


### Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`s = "welcome to the jungle"`

**Output:**  
`"jungle the to welcome"`

**Explanation:**  
The words in the input string are `"welcome"`, `"to"`, `"the"`, and `"jungle"`.  
Reversing the order of these words gives `"jungle"`, `"the"`, `"to"`, and `"welcome"`.  
The output string should have exactly one space between each word.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`s = " amazing coding skills "`

**Output:**  
`"skills coding amazing"`

**Explanation:**  
The input string has leading and trailing spaces, as well as multiple spaces between the words `"amazing"`, `"coding"`, and `"skills"`.  
After trimming the leading and trailing spaces and reducing the multiple spaces between words to a single space, the words are `"amazing"`, `"coding"`, and `"skills"`.  
Reversing the order of these words gives `"skills"`, `"coding"`, and `"amazing"`.  
The output string should not have any leading or trailing spaces and should have exactly one space between each word.

## Brute Force

### Algorithm
- Start by scanning the string to identify words, treating each word as a group of characters separated by spaces.
- Store these words in a list, making sure to skip any extra or multiple spaces.
- After collecting all the words, reverse the order of the list.
- Join the reversed words using a single space between them.
- Ensure the final result has no leading or trailing spaces.

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to reverse every word in the given string
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        int n = s.length(); // Length of string
        
        // List to store the words present in the string
        vector<string> words;
        
        // Pointers to mark the start and end of a word
        int start, end;
        
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n) {
            
            // Finding the first character of a word (if any)
            while(i < n && s[i] == ' ') i++;
            
            // If no word is found, break 
            if(i >= n) break;
            
            start = i; // Storing the index of the first character of the word
            
            // Finding the last character of the word
            while(i < n && s[i] != ' ') i++;
            
            end = i-1; // Storing the index of the last character of the word
            
            // Add the found word to the list of words
            string wordFound = s.substr(start, end-start+1);
            words.push_back(wordFound);
        }
        
        string ans = "";
        
        // Adding all the words to result in the reverse order 
        for(int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans += words[i];
            
            // Adding spaces in between words
            if(i != 0) ans.push_back(' ');
        }
        
        return ans; // Return the stored result
    } 
};

int main(){
    string s =  " amazing coding skills ";
    
    // Creating an instance of the Solution class
    Solution sol; 
    
    // Function call to reverse every word in the given string
    string ans = sol.reverseWords(s);
    
    // Output
    cout << "Input string: " << s << endl;
    cout << "After reversing every word: " << ans << endl;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: `O(n)`**  
`n` is the length of the input string. We scan the string once to extract words (`O(n)`), and then concatenate them in reverse order (`O(n)`), giving overall `O(n)` time.

**Space Complexity: `O(n)`**  
We store the extracted words in a list and build the result string. Both can take up to `O(n)` space in total.

## Optimal Approach

### Algorithm
- Begin by reversing the entire input string.
- Iterate over the reversed string to handle each word.
- Detect words as continuous sequences of characters separated by spaces.
- Reverse each identified word to restore its correct character order.
- Move the reversed word to the front while skipping extra spaces.
- Trim any trailing spaces before returning the final string.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    void reverseString(string &s, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            swap(s[start++], s[end--]);
        }
    }

public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        int n = s.length();

        // Reverse the entire string
        reverseString(s, 0, n - 1);

        int i = 0, j = 0, start = 0, end = 0;

        while (j < n) {
            // Skip spaces
            while (j < n && s[j] == ' ') j++;
            if (j == n) break;

            start = i;

            // Copy the word characters forward
            while (j < n && s[j] != ' ') {
                s[i++] = s[j++];
            }

            end = i - 1;

            // Reverse the current word using start and end
            reverseString(s, start, end);

            // Add a space after the word if it's not the last word
            if (j < n) {
                s[i++] = ' ';
            }
        }

        // Remove trailing space if present
        if (i > 0 && s[i - 1] == ' ') i--;

        return s.substr(0, i);
    }
};

int main() {
    string s = " amazing coding skills ";

    // Creating an instance of Solution class
    Solution sol;

    // Function call to reverse every word in the given string
    string ans = sol.reverseWords(s);

    // Output
    cout << "Input string: " << s << endl;
    cout << "After reversing every word: " << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (where `n` is the length of the input string)

- The input string is reversed first, taking `O(n)` time.
- The string is then traversed, taking another `O(n)` time.
- Each word encountered is reversed; across the whole string this totals `O(n)` time.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

**Space Complexity: `O(1)`**  
No additional space is used. The reversal is done in-place, requiring constant extra space.

> **Note:** In Java, space complexity can be `O(n)` if the solution converts the `String` to a character array, since Java strings are immutable.
