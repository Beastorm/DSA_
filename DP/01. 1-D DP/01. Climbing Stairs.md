## Dynamic Programming: Climbing Stairs

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a number of stairs. Starting from the 0th stair, we need to climb to the “Nth” stair. At a time, we can climb either one or two steps. We need to return the total number of distinct ways to reach from 0th to Nth stair.

### Points:
General Approach to Represent Problems Using Recursion
1. **Represent the problem in terms of an index.**
2. **At each index, perform all possible operations** according to the problem statement.
3. **Combine the results of recursive calls:**
   - Taking the **sum** gives the total number of ways.
   - Taking the **minimum** gives the optimal (minimum) answer.

>### Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:** n = 2  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** There are 2 unique ways to climb to the 2nd step:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

---

### Example 2:
**Input:** n = 3  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** There are 3 unique ways to climb to the 3rd step:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps + 1 step
3. 1 step + 2 steps

## Approach - All

### Algorithm:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with base cases F(0)=1 and F(1)=1. A naive recursive solution recalculates many subproblems, leading to exponential time. By storing results in a DP array, we avoid recomputation and compute the result efficiently.

**Approach:**
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `n+1` with -1 to store results.
2. Set the base cases: `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`.
3. Iterate from `i = 2` to `n` and compute `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.
4. Return `dp[n]` as the answer.

### C++ Code:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Recursive Solution
int climbStairsRecursive(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    return climbStairsRecursive(n - 1) + climbStairsRecursive(n - 2);
}

// Memoization Solution (Top-Down)
int climbStairsMemo(int n, vector<int>& dp) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    
    if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
    
    return dp[n] = climbStairsMemo(n - 1, dp) + climbStairsMemo(n - 2, dp);
}

// Tabulation Solution (Bottom-Up)
int climbStairsTabulation(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    
    vector<int> dp(n + 1);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Space Optimization Solution
int climbStairsSpaceOptimized(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    
    int prev2 = 1;
    int prev = 1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int curr = prev + prev2;
        prev2 = prev;
        prev = curr;
    }
    
    return prev;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    
    // Recursive
    cout << "Recursive: " << climbStairsRecursive(n) << endl;
    
    // Memoization
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1);
    cout << "Memoization: " << climbStairsMemo(n, dp) << endl;
    
    // Tabulation
    cout << "Tabulation: " << climbStairsTabulation(n) << endl;
    
    // Space Optimization
    cout << "Space Optimized: " << climbStairsSpaceOptimized(n) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

### Recursive Solution:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(2^N)` (Exponential)
  - Every function calls itself twice, creating a binary tree of calls.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - Recursion stack depth is equal to `N`.

### Memoization (Top-Down):
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - Each subproblem is solved only once and stored.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N) + O(N)`
  - `O(N)` for the DP array.
  - `O(N)` for the recursion stack.

### Tabulation (Bottom-Up):
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - A single loop runs from `2` to `N`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - `O(N)` for the DP array to store results.

### Space Optimization:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - A single loop runs from `2` to `N`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - Only three variables (`prev2`, `prev`, `curr`) are used, reducing space usage significantly.
