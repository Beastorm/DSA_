## Find Middle Element in a Linked List

**Problem Statement:**  
Given the head of a linked list of integers, determine the middle node of the linked list. However, if the linked list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.

>### Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**
LL: 1  2  3  4  5  
**Output:**  
3  
**Explanation:**  
Node with value 3 is the middle node of this linked list.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
LL: 1  2  3  4  5  6  
**Output:**  
4  
**Explanation:**  
In this example, the linked list has an even number of nodes, hence we return the second middle node, which is 4.

## Brute Force Approach

### Algorithm:

Using the brute force approach, we can find the middle node of a linked list by traversing the linked list and finding the total number of nodes as `count`. Then we reset the traversal pointer and traverse to the node at the [count/2 + 1]th position. That will be the middle node.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize** a pointer `temp` to the head of the linked list and a variable `count` to hold the number of nodes in the linked list. Using `temp`, traverse the linked list, increasing the value of `count` by one at each node until `temp` becomes null. The final value of `count` will represent the length of the linked list.

2. **Calculate** `mid` as `count/2 + 1` where `count` is the length of the linked list. `mid` represents the position of the middle node.

3. **Reset** the `temp` pointer back to the head and traverse the list by iteratively moving `temp` `mid` number of times. The node pointed to by `temp` after this traversal is the middle node of the linked list.


### C++ Code:
``` cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

// Node class represents a node in a linked list
class Node {
public:

    // Data stored in the node
    int data;  
    
     // Pointer to the next node in the list
    Node* next;     

    // Constructor with both data
    // and next node as parameters
    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data as
    // a parameter, sets next to nullptr
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to find the middle
// node of a linked list
Node *findMiddle(Node *head) {
    // If the list is empty or has only
    // one element, return the head as
    // it's the middle.
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        return head;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    int count = 0;

    // Count the number of nodes in the linked list.
    while (temp != NULL) {
        count++;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // Calculate the position of the middle node.
    int mid = count / 2 + 1;
    temp = head;

    // Traverse to the middle node by moving
    // temp to the middle position.
    while (temp != null) {
        mid = mid - 1;

        // Check if the middle
        // position is reached.
        if (mid == 0){
            // break out of the loop
            // to return temp
            break;
        }
        // Move temp ahead
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // Return the middle node.
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample linked list: 
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->next = new Node(3);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new Node(5);

    // Find the middle node
    Node* middleNode = findMiddle(head);

    // Display the value of the middle node
    cout << "The middle node value is: " << middleNode->data << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N + N/2)  
  The code traverses the entire linked list once to count the number of nodes and then again to get to the middle node. Therefore, the time complexity is linear, O(N + N/2) ≈ O(N).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  There is constant space complexity because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the linked list. We only use a few variables to keep track of the middle position and traverse the list, and the memory required for these variables does

## Optimal Approach

### Algorithm:

The previous method requires the traversal of the linked list twice. To enhance efficiency, the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm is introduced as an optimization where the middle node can be found in just one traversal.

The Tortoise and Hare algorithm leverages two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initiated at the beginning of the linked list. The `slow` pointer advances one node at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two nodes at a time.

### C++ Code:
``` cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

// Node class represents a node in a linked list
class Node {
public:

    // Data stored in the node
    int data;  
    
     // Pointer to the next node in the list
    Node* next;     

    // Constructor with both data
    // and next node as parameters
    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data as
    // a parameter, sets next to nullptr
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to find the middle
// node of a linked list
Node *findMiddle(Node *head) {
    
     // Initialize the slow pointer to the head.
    Node *slow = head; 
    
     // Initialize the fast pointer to the head.
    Node *fast = head; 

    // Traverse the linked list using the
    // Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        // Move slowly one step.
        slow = slow->next; 
         // Move fast two steps.
        fast = fast->next->next; 
    }
    
    
     // Return the slow pointer,
     // which is now at the middle node.
    return slow; 
}


int main() {
    // Creating a sample linked list: 
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->next = new Node(3);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new Node(5);

    // Find the middle node
    Node* middleNode = findMiddle(head);

    // Display the value of the middle node
    cout << "The middle node value is: " << middleNode->data << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N/2)  
  The algorithm requires the 'fast' pointer to reach the end of the list, which it does after approximately N/2 iterations (where N is the total number of nodes). Therefore, the maximum number of iterations needed to find the middle node is proportional to the number of nodes in the list, making the time complexity linear, or O(N/2) ≈ O(N).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  There is constant space complexity because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the linked list. We only use a few variables to keep track of the middle position and traverse the list, and the memory required for these variables does not depend on the size of the list.
