## Starting Point of Loop in a Linked List

**Problem Statement:**  
Given the head of a linked list that may contain a cycle, return the starting point of that cycle. If there is no cycle in the linked list, return null.

>### Examples:

- **Input:** LL: 1  2  3  4  5  
  **Output:** 3  
  **Explanation:** This linked list contains a loop of size 3 starting at the node with value 3.

- **Input:** LL: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 9  
  **Output:** NULL  
  **Explanation:** This linked list does not contain a loop, hence has no starting point.

## Brute Force Approach

### Algorithm:

The starting point of a loop in the linked list is the first node we visit twice during its traversal. It's the point where we realize that we are no longer moving forward in the list but rather entering a cycle.

1. Traverse through the linked list by assigning a temporary node to the head and moving to the next node repeatedly until reaching null.
2. While traversing, keep a record of visited nodes using a map data structure.
3. Storing the entire node in the map is necessary to differentiate between nodes with the same value but different positions, ensuring proper detection of cycles instead of just duplicates.
4. If a node already exists in the map, this confirms a loop, and we return that node as the starting point of the loop.
5. If the traversal reaches the end of the list (null), it means no loop exists, so return null.


### C++ Code:
``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class ListNode {
public:
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to detect start of loop using HashMap
    ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
        // Create a map to store visited nodes
        unordered_set<ListNode*> visited;

        // Start traversing from the head
        while (head != NULL) {
            // If the current node is already in the set, it's the start of a loop
            if (visited.find(head) != visited.end()) {
                return head;
            }

            // Otherwise, insert the current node into the set
            visited.insert(head);

            // Move to the next node
            head = head->next;
        }

        // If loop not found, return NULL
        return NULL;
    }
};

// Driver code
int main() {
    // Creating nodes
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);

    // Creating a cycle (tail connects to node index 1)
    head->next->next->next->next = head->next;

    Solution obj;
    ListNode* startNode = obj.detectCycle(head);

    if (startNode)
        cout << "Cycle starts at node with value: " << startNode->val << endl;
    else
        cout << "No cycle found." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
  where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited only once during traversal. Hashing allows O(1) lookup to check for previously visited nodes.

- **Space Complexity:** O(N)  
  Due to the additional hash set used to store visited nodes. In the worst case (no cycle), all N nodes will be stored in the hash set.

## Optimal Approach

### Algorithm:

The previous method uses O(N) additional memory, which can become quite large as the linked list length grows. To enhance efficiency, the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm is introduced as an optimization.

The Tortoise and Hare approach has been discussed in this article. The key insight is that when the slow and fast pointers meet inside the loop, the distance travelled by each pointer can be used to calculate the starting point of the loop.

1. Initialise two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. `slow` will advance one step at a time, while `fast` will advance two steps at a time. These pointers will move simultaneously.
2. Traverse the linked list with the `slow` and `fast` pointers. While traversing, repeatedly move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time.
3. Continue this traversal until one of the following conditions is met:
   - `fast` or `fast.next` reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., becomes null). In this case, there is no loop in the linked list, and the algorithm terminates by returning null.
   - `fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node. This indicates the presence of a loop in the linked list.
4. Reset the `slow` pointer to the head of the linked list. Move `fast` and `slow` one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet again is the starting point of the loop.

### Proof Outline:

- When the slow pointer (tortoise) reaches the starting point of the loop, the fast pointer (hare) is positioned at a point that is twice the distance travelled by the slow pointer, since the hare moves at double the speed.
- If slow has travelled distance L1, then fast has travelled 2 × L1. After entering the loop, the distance fast needs to cover to catch up to slow is the total length of the loop minus L1 (let this distance be d).
- The gap between them decreases by 1 with each step, so it takes exactly d steps for them to meet.
- During these d steps, the slow pointer travels d steps from the starting point within the loop, and the fast pointer travels 2 × d. They meet at a specific point, and the remaining distance within the loop is equal to L1.
- Therefore, the distance between the starting point of the loop and the point where the two pointers meet is equal to the distance between the starting point and the head of the linked list.

### C++ Code:

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class ListNode {
public:
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to detect the starting point of the loop using Floyd’s algorithm
    ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
        // Initialize slow and fast pointers
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        // Traverse until fast and fast->next are not null
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            // Move slow by one step
            slow = slow->next;

            // Move fast by two steps
            fast = fast->next->next;

            // If they meet, loop is detected
            if (slow == fast) {
                // Reset slow to head
                slow = head;

                // Move both one step at a time to find starting point
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow->next;
                    fast = fast->next;
                }

                // Return the start node of the loop
                return slow;
            }
        }

        // If no loop found, return NULL
        return NULL;
    }
};

// Driver code
int main() {
    // Create nodes
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);

    // Create a cycle: connect tail to index 1 node (value 2)
    head->next->next->next->next = head->next;

    Solution obj;
    ListNode* result = obj.detectCycle(head);

    if (result != NULL)
        cout << "Cycle starts at node with value: " << result->val << endl;
    else
        cout << "No cycle found." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
  where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we traverse the entire list once with the slow and fast pointers, and then again to find the entry point of the loop.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Constant extra space. No additional data structures are used, only two pointers.
