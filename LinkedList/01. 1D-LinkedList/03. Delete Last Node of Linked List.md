## Delete Last Node of Linked List

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a Linked List, delete the tail of the list and print the updated list.

---

>### Examples:

### Example 1:
  **Input:** 0->1->2  
  **Output:** 0->1  
  **Explanation:** Last node of the Linked List is 2.

### Example 2:
  **Input:** 12->5->8->7  
  **Output:** 12->5->8  
  **Explanation:** Last node of the Linked List is 7.

## Approach

### Algorithm:

1. To delete the tail of a linked list, update the linkage between its last node and its second last node. The main intuition is to point the second last node to null to get the updated linked list.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the list is empty, return immediately as there is nothing to delete.
   - If the list has only one node, delete the node and return an empty list.

3. Traverse the linked list to the second last node and keep track of it using a pointer.

4. Set the next pointer of the second last node to null. This step effectively disconnects the initial tail node from the list, making the second last node the new tail node.

5. Deallocate the memory occupied by the tail node by deleting it.

6. Return the head of the linked list as the result.

### C++ Code:

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Definition for singly linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to delete the tail node of the linked list
    Node* deleteTail(Node* head) {
        // If the list is empty or has one node
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
            delete head;
            return NULL;
        }

        // Traverse to the second last node
        Node* curr = head;
        while (curr->next->next != NULL) {
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        // Delete tail node
        delete curr->next;
        curr->next = NULL;

        // Return updated head
        return head;
    }
};

// Driver code
int main() {
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->next = new Node(3);

    Solution obj;
    head = obj.deleteTail(head);

    // Print list after deletion
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    return 0;
}

```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, we traverse the entire linked list once to delete the tail of the list.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, constant amount of extra space is used.
