## Linked List: Introduction

### What is a Linked List?

Imagine you are given a task where you have to maintain a data entry of cars entering a parking lot. Since the number of cars entering will be different and may change daily, constructing a fixed-sized data structure like an array might not be helpful. This is when **linked lists** come into the picture, which allows us to add and remove cars easily. 

**Linked List** is a linear data structure that can be visualized as a chain with different nodes connected, where each node represents a different element. The difference between arrays and linked lists is that, unlike arrays, the elements are **not stored at a contiguous location**.

> For any element to be added to an array, we need the exact next memory location to be empty, and it is impossible to guarantee that it is possible. Hence, adding elements to an array is not possible after the initial assignment of size.

A linked list is a data structure containing two crucial pieces of information:
- The first is the **data**
- The other is the **pointer to the next element**

The `head` is the first node, and the `tail` is the last node in a linked list.


### Creating a Linked List:

There are two information sets to store at every node, thus there is a need to create a **self-defined data type** to handle them. Therefore, we will use the help of `structs` and `classes.

```
     HEAD TAIL
       |   |
       v   v
      +------+------+ +------+------+ +------+------+ +------+------+------+-----+
      | Data | Next | --> | Data | Next | --> | Data | Next | --> | Data | NULL |
      +------+------+ +------+------+ +------+------+ +------+------+------+-----+
      Node 1               Node 2             Node 3               Node 4
```

``` cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Node class represents a node in the linked list
class Node {
public:
    int data;     // Data value
    Node* next;   // Pointer to next node

    // Constructor with data and next
    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an array
    vector<int> arr = {2, 5, 8, 7};

    // Create first node
    Node* y = new Node(arr[0]);

    // Print memory location of node
    cout << y << '\n';

    // Print data stored in node
    cout << y->data << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
