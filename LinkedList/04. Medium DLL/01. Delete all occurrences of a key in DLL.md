## Delete all occurrences of a key in the DLL
**Problem Statement:**   
Given the head of a doubly linked list and an integer `k`, delete all occurrences of nodes with value `k` from the list. Return the head of the updated linked list.

>### Examples:

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 4`, k = 2  
**Output:** `1 <-> 3 <-> 4`  
**Explanation:** All nodes with value 2 are removed.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `2 <-> 2 <-> 2`, k = 2  
**Output:** (empty list)  
**Explanation:** All nodes are deleted as all have a value of 2.

## Approach
### Algo:

- Traverse the doubly linked list.
- For each node, if its value is equal to `k`, remove it from the list.
- If the node to be deleted is the head, update the head pointer.
- Adjust the `prev` and `next` pointers of neighboring nodes to maintain the list structure.
- Free the memory of the deleted node.
- Continue until the end of the list.

### Steps:

1. Initialize a pointer `temp` to the head of the list.
2. While `temp` is not NULL:
    - If `temp->data == k`:
        - If `temp` is the head, update `head` to `temp->next`.
        - Set `nextNode = temp->next` and `prevNode = temp->prev`.
        - If `nextNode` is not NULL, set `nextNode->prev = prevNode`.
        - If `prevNode` is not NULL, set `prevNode->next = nextNode`.
        - Free the memory of `temp`.
        - Move `temp` to `nextNode`.
    - Else, move `temp` to `temp->next`.
3. Return the updated `head`.

### C++ Code:

```cpp
Node* deleteAllOccurrences(Node* head, int k) {
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        if (temp->data == k) {
            // If this is the head of the LL, update the head after deletion
            if (temp == head) {
                head = temp->next;
            }
            Node* nextNode = temp->next;
            Node* prevNode = temp->prev;
            if (nextNode != NULL) nextNode->prev = prevNode;
            if (prevNode != NULL) prevNode->next = nextNode;
            free(temp);
            temp = nextNode;
        } else {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```
### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
  where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  As no extra space is used apart from a few pointers.
